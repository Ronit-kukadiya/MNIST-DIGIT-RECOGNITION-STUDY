# MNIST-DIGIT-RECOGNITION-STUDY

ðŸ“Œ **A machine learning and deep learning-based study on the MNIST dataset, implemented from scratch and compared across multiple models.** 

this project used [DataSet](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset) provided on kaggle to make a **step-by-step study** of MNIST digit recognition using **Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models.** It explores **data preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, and visualization**, leading up to a **Flask-based web app for digit prediction**.
